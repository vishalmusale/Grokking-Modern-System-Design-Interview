# Conclusions

Before we conclude, we’d like to congratulate you for completing such a challenging course!

In this course, we learned system design activity from the lens of basic building blocks—the fundamental subsystems that combine to make a bigger system. Doing so enabled us to focus on the specific business use cases instead of repeating the recurring concepts.



We carefully selected our design problems from many different domains, and we've made an explicit effort to incorporate some unique aspects or issues of system design activity in each of them.
