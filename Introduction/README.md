# What is system design?

```
System design is the process of defining components and their integration, APIs, and data models to build large-scale systems that meet a specified set of functional and non-functional requirements.
```

System design uses the concepts of computer networking, parallel computing, and distributed systems to craft systems that scale well and are performant.

System design aims to build systems that are reliable, effective, and maintainable, among other characteristics.

```
•	Reliable systems handle faults, failures, and errors.
•	Effective systems meet all user needs and business requirements.
•	Maintainable systems are flexible and easy to scale up or down. The ability to add new features also comes under the umbrella of maintainability.
```
